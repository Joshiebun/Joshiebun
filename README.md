## Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

My name is Josh, or Joshie! I have a deep-seated love for programming and everything about it. Nice to meet you!

I love learning about technology and using what I've learned to make applications for practical use or for entertainment. Some of my friends would call me a nerd.

My favorite language is **C#** and I use it for most of my aplications. I also enjoy using PHP, Java, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Python, and C++.

Right now I'm learning Go so I can make delightful little applications using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [Wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish).

### Secret Projects...
There are a lot of things hidden under the covers, and I hope to unearth them soon!

### CL-211
A vast Alternate Reality Game (ARG) with a captivating story, CL-211 is a tribute to Cicada 3301, a set of three very substantial puzzles that required extensive knowledge on topics such as cryptography and steganography.

### Sublime Dice
I'm currently working on **SublimeDice** which is a virtual dice rolling game. It presents a pretty interface for end-users using .NET's WinForms, and communicates with a MySQL server on the Internet.
